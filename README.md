Welcome to Disasterbase!

## What is the Project about?
Disasterbase is a database for natural disasters. Data visualization of earthquake data on map. (Responsive) Design.

## User story:
Increasing number of people traveling the world. The Mission is to help people before, during, and after disasters: provide information, real-time action, and generation preparatory information. 

## Key features:
- Map - data visualization of earthquake data on map and in table (Search, filter & sort Table and Map, Marker shaped as circle, OnClick zoom)
- Notification (Nodemailer) (create a list of emergency contacts, send email in case of emergency)
- Information (embedded Youtube videos)

## How does the tech work under the hood?
MERN stack - MongoDB, Express, React, Node. In addition, I used the Nodemailer for sending emails and several packages. In the course of the porject development I took some time to explore how packages work and how they interact with React modules. 

## Summary
This was the first app I developed on my own. I had so much fun creating it and will continue working on it. I'd be happy to get any feedback/comments.

Hope you enjoyed playing with the app! Cheers, J.
